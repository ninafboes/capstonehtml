        <div class="col border border-4 border-dark p-2 text-dark bg-opacity-25"><h2>Root Cause #1:</h2>
          <p>If women continued past Calculus 1 at the same rate as men, they could make up 37% of the current workforce opposed to 25%. Many women lack confidence in their mathematical abilities, making them not continue to Calculus 2 at the same rate as men. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row row-cols-2">
        <div class="col border border-4 border-dark p-2 text-dark bg-opacity-25"><h4>Evidence:</h4>
          <p>Numbers for switching out of calculus bc of lack of understanding
            <p>Stem-intending: 35% women, 14% men. P score of 0.026%. </p>
            <p>Stem-interested: 32% women, 20% men. P score of 0.051%</p>
            <p>These are statistically significant results</p>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col border border-4 border-dark p-2 text-dark bg-opacity-25"><h3>Explanation:</h3>
        <p>Stem-intending is people with a declared STEM major. Stem-interested is people interested in STEM fields. A P score of 0.026% is essentially explaining the chance that these numbers are caused by randomization as opposed to gender. If our intended p-value is 0.05%, this means that both of the numbers are statistically significant. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col border border-4 border-dark p-2 text-dark bg-opacity-25"><h3>Evidence:</h3>
        <p>In a Calculus test explained by Jacob Clark Blickenstaff, 55.1% of girls earned a score of C or higher, while 52.5% of boys earned the same score. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col border border-4 border-dark p-2 text-dark bg-opacity-25"><h3>Explanation:</h3>
        <p>This highlights that skill is not the primary reason why women drop out of Calculus at a higher rate. On average, they score the same, if not more than men.</p>

      <div class="row row-cols-1">
        <div class="col border border-4 border-dark p-2 text-dark bg-opacity-25"><h2>Implications:</h2>
          <p>If lack of confidence is the cause of the issue, that definitely changes the approach to solving the problem. We must identify other factors that influence this confidence issue such as classroom/home environment, extracurricular, and mentors. If we can figure out what causes the lack of confidence, we can then attempt to improve these factors. </p>

        <div class="col border border-4 border-dark p-2 text-dark bg-opacity-25"><h2>Root Cause #1:</h2>
          <p>Implicit and explicit bias surrounding men and women in STEM fields causes fewer women to pursue these STEM majors and careers.  </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row row-cols-2">
        <div class="col border border-4 border-dark p-2 text-dark bg-opacity-25"><h4>Evidence:</h4>
          <p>On average, boys are expected to prefer things that are competitive and active while girls are expected to prefer activities that are communal and help others. This leads to men pursuing jobs with self-serving, thing-oriented, money, and competitive values, and women pursuing jobs with helping others, people-oriented, family, and fulfilling values. STEM appears to be focused on competition, power, everyone for themselves, isolation, and status. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col border border-4 border-dark p-2 text-dark bg-opacity-25"><h3>Explanation:</h3>
        <p>From childhood, the different genders are fed different ideas of things that they should prefer. This creates a bias ingrained in people, changing their life choices. If STEM fields are labeled with values that are primarily associated with men, it lessens the number of women that want to study in that major. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col border border-4 border-dark p-2 text-dark bg-opacity-25"><h3>Evidence:</h3>
        <p>At 6 years old, both genders associate boys with math. In elementary/middle school, 58% think men=math/science, women=art, while only 17% thought the opposite. This increases in age, with 68% of high schoolers and 71% of college students believing the same. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col border border-4 border-dark p-2 text-dark bg-opacity-25"><h3>Explanation:</h3>
        <p>If most of the population associates men with sciences/math and women with art, it makes the women believe it too. It is very difficult to ignore the norms and pursue a career that most of the population doesnâ€™t think of you in. </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row row-cols-1">
        <div class="col border border-4 border-dark p-2 text-dark bg-opacity-25"><h2>Implications:</h2>
          <p>If the root cause is implicit and explicit bias, solutions must focus on changing these biases. One way that we could do this is by bringing more awareness to the problem. Alternatively, parents must learn to not teach their children gender-based values might help increase the number of women in STEM. </p>
